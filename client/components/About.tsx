    <p>
      I am a former civil engineer who has found a new passion for software
      development. My time as a civil engineer has allowed me to develop
      excellent communication, problem-solving, and time-management skills. I
      worked on major infrastructure construction projects, being fully
      responsible for multiple sites simultaneously.
      <br /> Most recently, I have been undergoing a full stack web development
      course at the Dev Academy. I have made projects using JavaScript and
      TypeScript alongside React, Express.js, and Knex SQLite.
      <br />
      While my career path has shifted, my passion for problem-solving remains
      unwavering. I&apos;m driven by the opportunity to tackle complex
      challenges and create innovative solutions.
